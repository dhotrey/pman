# pman
pman is a command-line tool to keep track of all your side projects.

## Why?
I needed something to keep track of all my side projects.

## Install using the go package manager

go install github.com/theredditbandit/pman@latest
```

  alias       Sets the alias for a project, whose name might be too big
  completion  Generate the autocompletion script for the specified shell
  delete      Deletes a project from the index database. This does not delete the project from the filesystem
  help        Help about any command
  i           Launches pman in interactive mode
  info        The info command pretty prints the README.md file present at the root of the specified project.
  init        Takes exactly 1 argument, a directory name, and initializes it as a project directory.

Use "pman [command] --help" for more information about a command.
```

## How does it work

### init
when you run `pman init .` in any directory, it will look for subdirectories that contain a README.md or a .git folder and consider it as a project directory.
